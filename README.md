# Games written in Python

These games were created to learn the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) module, and to exercise the basics of game development.

It is also possible that an automatic machine learning based solver will be developed for these games.

The reconstructed games include the:
- [Laptop mini-game from nopixel](https://nopixel.fandom.com/wiki/Heist_Hacks)
- [Thermite mini-game from nopixel](https://nopixel.fandom.com/wiki/Heist_Hacks)
- [Tetris game](https://tetris.com/play-tetris)


For detailed information about how the games work take a look at the specific game's folder.

# Installation

To run the games you need `python` installed on your computer.
