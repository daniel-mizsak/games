# Tetris game

## Objective

Tetris is an already pretty well documented game, so it is advised to take a
look at its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)

However, your basic task is to position the falling shapes in a way that a row
is totally filled, so that it will disappear. The game ends, when the whole
boards is filled with incomplete rows, and you no longer can move the shape.
