# Termite mini-game from NoPixel's GTA server

Your task is to keep solving puzzles as long as you can.

At the beginning of each puzzle you are shown a pattern of tiles.

After these tiles disappear you have to click on the position of all previously shown tiles. If you were right the tile becomes white, but if you were wrong it
becomes red.

There is not time limitation, but if you have missed 3 tiles the game ends, but you can always try again.
